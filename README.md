Fundamentals of Programming II - all labs and assignments coded in Java. Studied and practiced implementing abstract data types, developing appropriate recursive or iterative solutions, and using object oriented programming. I learned valuable problem solving and critical thinking skills in this course that I will carry into future projects and learning.

Not all code in assignment files is my own. Some files, instructions and/or methods were provided as part of the assignments. All of my code is labeled as my own in the form of comments. Credit to Professor Estey at Uvic for assignment materials.
